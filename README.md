```
A simple cosol application that counts graphs. 
When given a neighborhood list or a neighborhood matrix, the application counts:
-neighborhood list
-neighborhood matrix
-decision matrix
-wide search (from vertex 0)
-depth search (from vertex 0)
-coloring vertices using the least number of colors
-coloring vertices using random colors

Graphs can be entered in the form of a neighborhood list, 
neighborhood matrix or by loading them from a .txt file
```

## Input 

 An example graph written as a neighborhood list and a neighborhood matrix:
